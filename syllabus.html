 	<p>Students are responsible for staying current on all course announcements.</p>

 	<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>     
	<p>
   	At the end of this course, successful students will be able to do all of the following:
 	</p>
 
 	<ul>
  		<li>Independently design programs</li>
  		<li>Produce professional-quality code</li>
  		<li>Implement large programs</li>
  		<li>Design and execute tests to identify software bugs</li>
  		<li>Repair software bugs, redesigning and refactoring code when necessary</li>
  		<li>Utilize, analyze, and critique code written by others</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Assessment of these outcomes will be done by a combination of quizzes, exams, labs, projects, and code review.</p>


	<h3>Course Requirements</h3> 


	<h4>Projects</h4>
	<p>You will have six projects. As noted below, they will <i>not</i> be weighted equally. A demonstration and interactive grading session will be required for most projects. Projects will be graded both on functionality (correctness) as well as design. A correct solution may not earn full credit if it is poorly designed or inefficient. A project may only be submitted late in the case of an emergency verified by the dean's office.</p>

	<h4>Project Resubmission</h4>
	<p>A student may resubmit up to <b>two</b> out of the first four projects (Project 0, Project 1, Project 2, or Project 3) a maximum of one time. Project 4 and the Side Project are not eligible for resubmission. Resubmissions that meet the following criteria may earn additional credit for the <b>design</b> requirements:
	<ul>
		<li>The original submission earned full credit on <i>all</i> <b>functionality</b> requirements. A solution that did not meet all functionality requirements may not be resubmitted.</li>
		<li>The student meets with the professor in advance of the resubmission for a code review.</li>
		<li>The code review takes place no more than <i>one week</i> after the project grade has been released and the resubmission is submitted no more than <i>two weeks</i> after the project grade has been released. For example, if the project grade is released on October 19 then the code review must be completed by October 26 and the resubmission must be submitted by November 2.</li>
		<li>The resubmission must meet all original functionality requirements to be eligible for additional credit.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>You are advised to think carefully about which projects you wish to resubmit. If, for example, you choose to resubmit Projects 0 and 1 then you will not be eligible for a resubmission of a later project. You are also advised to manage your time wisely. If you spend significant time revising Project 1 rather than completing Project 2 then you are likely to get behind and do poorly on Project 2.</p>

	<h3>Exams</h3>
	<p>You will have two exams. You are responsible for being present on the day of the exam.  Make-up exams will only be given in the event of an emergency verified by the dean's office.</p>

	<h3>Labs, Quizzes, In-Class Exercises, Participation</h3>
	<p>Additional programming labs may be assigned. In many cases you will have class time to work on these labs but they will need to be completed outside of class. </p>

	<p>You are expected to attend class, participate in class discussion, and participate in online discussion on Slack. <i>Pop quizzes and in-class exercises/worksheets may be administered any time. If you are not in class on the day of the quiz or exercise you will be assigned a 0.</i></p>

	<h3>Code Review</h3>
	<p>Any student may be asked to come in for code review for any assignment. A student who does not meet with the instructor for a code review in a timely manner will be given a <strong>0</strong> on the assignment in question. A student who is unable to explain his/her code; answer the instructor's questions about his/her code; or reproduce his/her code as expected may receive a deduction of <i>up to</i> <strong>100%</strong>, resulting in a 0 on the assignment.</p>

	<h3>Letter Grades</h3> 
	<p>Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:</p>


	<table class="table table-condensed" style="text-align:left;">
 		<tr>
  			<td>A+ ≥97%</td>
  			<td>B+ ≥87%</td>
  			<td>C+ ≥77%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		</tr>
			<td>A ≥94%</td>
			<td>B ≥84%</td>
			<td>C ≥74%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
  			<td>A- ≥90%</td>
  			<td>B- ≥80%</td>
  			<td>C- ≥70%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
  		<td colspan="3">F < 70%</td>
			</tr>
	</table>

	<p>For example, you will receive a C letter grade if your grade is greater than or equal to 74% and less than 77%. Please note this scale is subject to change. See the <a href="https://catalog.usfca.edu/content.php?catoid=35&navoid=8277">Graduate Student Regulations</a> for more information about letter grades and how they are translated into GPA.</p>

	<h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
	<p>Students are expected to be on-time to all classes. Attendance is mandatory for all exams, quizzes, labs, and exercises. Exam dates will be posted on the course <a href="/schedule.html">schedule</a>.</p>

	<h3>Late Policy</h3>
	<p>All deadlines are firm.</p>
	<p>Exceptions to this policy are made only in the case of <i>verifiable</i> medical or family emergency. Extensions and makeup exams must be arranged <i>PRIOR</i> to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).</p>

	<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>

	<p>All students are expected to know and adhere to the University of San Francisco's Academic Honor Code. Go to <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code">https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code</a> for details.</p>
	<p>You must never represent another person’s work as your own.</p>
	<p>Copying answers or code from other students or sources during a quiz, exam, or for a project or homework assignment is a violation of the university’s honor code.This includes copying code or other material from the web, and having anyone other than yourself complete your assignments. It also includes working too closely with another student. Collaboration or discussion that results in the same or very similar code indicates that you have not placed enough independent work into your solution and is a violation of the honor code.</p>
	<p>Flagrant or repeat violations of the honor code will result in an F in the course, a report to the University Academic Integrity Committee, and a report to the Dean.</p>
	<p>At the discretion of the instructor, a less severe penalty may be imposed for minor or first offenses. This is at the sole discretion of the instructor and any violation may result in an F in the course.</p>
	<p>Examples of honor code violations include but are not limited to:</p>
	<ul>
 		<li>Giving your code to another student.</li>
 		<li>Submitting code written by anyone other than yourself as your own.</li>
 		<li>Copying text from the web.</li>
 		<li>Discussing implementation details of a solution with another student.</li>
 		<li>Discussing code-specific details of a solution with another student.</li>    	    
	</ul>
